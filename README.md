## Abstract

LEACH protocol is amplified by analyze a cluster head in consonance to the lowest degree of distance 
from the base station to diminish power consumption in cluster head nodes and in the whole network. 
The main value of LEACH is that each node has the exact probability to be a cluster head, which 
makes the energy wasted of each node be comparatively balanced. The functions of lifetime and 
throughput correlative to the time of length of each round are gathered. all These functions may be
used to improve the performance of cluster-based wireless sensor networks in terms of lifetime and 
throughput. WSN is composed of multiple unattended ultra-small, limited-power sensor nodes 
deployed randomly in the area of interest such as inaccessible areas or disaster places for collecting the
useful information. Miniature sensor nodes ca-able of sensing, processing useful information from, 
and transmitting to destination has opened many research issues. In our endeavor technique that we 
evaluate and enhance specific issues. For example, network stability, network lifetime, and cluster 
head selection process. We use the idea of distinctive pairing between sensor nodes energy utilization 
is improved. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), with developed applications in the world that are not 
within human reach, have been addressed broadly in the current past. For enhance the working of the 
network, a lot of routing algorithms have been suggested, at most focusing on energy efficiency, 
network lifetime, clustering processes. Considering the homogeneity of the network, we proposed an 
(EESAA)creative routing protocol for WSNs. In our recommended technique we assess and improve 
certain problems like network stability, network lifetime, and cluster head selection process. Utilizing 
the concept of characteristics pairing between sensor nodes energy utilization is improved. Simulation 
outcomes show that our formulated protocol inefficiently expanded the network parameters and can be 
a useful strategy for WSNs.


## Introduction

In wireless sensor networks, each sensor node has a certain number of energies to perform tasks such as 
communication between nodes, computing, etc. They are generally deployed so their batteries are difficult 
to access and replace. A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a big number of sensor nodes for 
energy, storage, and activity force. the node master returns data to data collection and then returns the
collected data to the base station (BS). Then, the network lifetime and laws turn into the main laws for the 
efficient and effective design of data collection techniques in WSN.

Therefore, a protocol designed to save energy to be more qualitative and efficient, reduce energy 
consumption and contribute to prolonging network lifetime. In this report, we will talk about the two most 
important protocols that contribute to saving energy and increasing network lifetime and throughput:

#### 1. Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol:
LEACH protocol known for providing data collection is introduced. Provides energy efficient routing in 
wireless sensor network based on all good data and optimized aggregation. In this system, the number of 
arrows per group is to reduce the power to hold the sensors and to optimize the use of resources. Energy 
saving steering can be obtained by nodes which become maximum residual power. Hence, the highest 
power transmission nodes are selected directing the data to the BS. Helps provide better packet ratio with 
better energy use. It is a very important and useful protocol as it saves a lot of energy and does not need 
control information, in addition to that it is fully distributed. But he has a few flaws, such as that the 
division of groups is random and unorganized, and this is negative in many cases, and if the head of the 
block dies, it becomes useless and we need another head, and this may be considered costly and cause a 
loss of time.
The usability of LEACH protocol is considered as: A Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network is typically a 
Wireless Sensor Network which deals with multimedia data (e.g., video or audio). A Wireless Multimedia 
Sensor Networks have their own properties: they deal with a large amount of data and have strict Quality 
of Service requirements. We show that most routing protocols for WSNs are not appropriate to WMSNs, 
by using the LEACH protocols as examples. Moreover, we show that these protocols fail to provide the 
required Quality of Service (QoS), consume a large amount of energy, and require large frame sizes. 
Finally, we present the key issues in adapting LEACH protocols for a Wireless Multimedia Sensor 
Networks, to routing and MAC layers.
